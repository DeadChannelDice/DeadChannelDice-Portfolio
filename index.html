                <p class="bio-content">I'm a versatile and experienced industrial designer, with a passion for creating and building products that make a difference. Over the course of my career, I've designed everything from military helmets to barcode scanners, and I've worked at companies ranging from small startups to large corporations. Currently, I'm working as a project manager for a model train exhibit, where I'm leading a team of 40 model makers to create an unforgettable experience for visitors.

                    When I'm not working, I'm an avid Dungeons and Dragons player and even run games professionally for kids as part of an afterschool program. I also have a passion for motorcycles, and although I had to sell mine due to circumstances, I dream of getting another one someday. I also love track riding and the adrenaline rush it brings.
                    
                    In addition to my design skills, I have a talent for managing complex projects and adapting to change quickly. I'm always learning and expanding my knowledge, whether it's learning new programming languages or tinkering with my own creations.
                    
                    I'm excited to showcase my portfolio and share my passion for design and creating with you. Thank you for visiting my site, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.</p>
